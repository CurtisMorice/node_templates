Migration off bind, preparation


The idea here is to build up to using
  node
  express
  template language (underscore and mustache look to be the leaders right now)
  backbone (for the data models)

Then build up to having template language with partials
  that should do it for replacing bind
  

basic
  a basic node app with express

undertest
  uses underscore and does server side template application
